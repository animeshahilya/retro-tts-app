/* Odds and ends of the Delta runtime.

 * Six primitives from five different objects that have nothing in common
 * except being small and standing on their own. They are here together
 * rather than in five files because each of them would otherwise be a file
 * with one function in it.
 *
 * Everything here takes the machine as its first argument and reaches what
 * it needs through it: the variable block at 0x68, the owner at 0x64, the
 * logical file table at 0x74. Where a field has no name in delta.h yet it is
 * named here by offset, because these are the only places that touch it.
 *
 * Names carry no prefix: these are plain C names in the original and ours
 * are the same, which is what stands the original's aside.
